    "When a codeword is sent through a physical channel, some bits may be corrupted. As a result, the received message might differ from the original codeword. Decoding aims to recover the original codeword despite these errors. Without knowing the exact errors that occurred, we cannot be certain that decoding will find the intended message. So instead we try to find the codeword that is most likely to have been sent. More precisely, let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a code of length $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and suppose we receive a message $m \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. Then we wish to find a codeword $\\hat{c} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that \n",

    "Notice that $\\mathbb{P}(m)$ does not depend on the specific codeword $c$, and so, to maximise $\\mathbb{P}(c \\mid m)$ over the code $\\mathcal{C}$ it suffices to maximise $$\\mathbb{P}(m \\mid c)\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(c)$$ over $\\mathcal{C}$. To do this, we first make a couple of assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform codeword distribution:** Each codeword is equally likely to be sent. That is, for all codewords $c \\in \\mathcal{C}$ we have that $$\\mathbb{P}(c) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{C}|}.$$ Thus, maximising $\\mathbb{P}(m \\mid c)\\cdot \\mathbb{P}(c)$ over $\\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to maximising $\\mathbb{P}(m \\mid c)$ over $\\mathcal{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **All errors are bit-flips:** A codeword $c \\in \\mathcal{C}$ produces a message $m$ that is a binary string of the same length. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bit-flips are independent:** Each bit flips independently of others. That is, for a message $m=m_1m_2\\dots m_n$ and a codeword $c=c_1c_2\\dots c_n$, we have that\n",
    "    $$\\mathbb{P}(m \\mid c) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{P}(m_i \\mid c_i).$$\n",

Therefore, as the code gets bigger the Maximum Likelihood Decoder becomes computationally impractical. We need more efficient algorithms that estimate the most likely codeword without having to compute the Hamming distances explicitly."

    "Maximum likelihood decoding identifies the most likely codeword for a received message by comparing it against every possible codeword. While this is theoretically optimal, it becomes infeasible for practical codes because the number of codewords grows exponentially with the code rank. Message passing is a scalable alternative. It is a graph-based algorithm where each node has local information and can communicate only with its immediate neighbours. Nodes iteratively update their knowledge based on messages received, and through repeated exchanges, information spreads across the network. Over time, global properties can be inferred even though no node initially has complete knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Message passing is a analogy of social networks. People who spend a lot of time together tend to share opinions and information. Each individual updates their understanding based on what they hear from friends. Then when they passes this updated information along to other friends. As this process iterates, ideas and knowledge propagate through the network, allowing people to build a collective understanding even without direct access to everyone’s thoughts.\n",
