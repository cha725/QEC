    "Suppose Alice and Bob agree that Alice will turn the kitchen light on if she is working from home and turn it off otherwise. The idea is efficient but it depends entirely on the light functioning. If the bulb fails, Bob may draw the wrong conclusion despite Alice’s intention remaining unchanged. To reduce this risk Alice could instead turn on the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom lights. It is unlikely that all three bulbs fail at once, so Bob is far more likely to receive the intended message.\n",

    "This is an example of classical error correction. Using multiple bulbs introduces redundancy into the communication channel so that even when parts of the physical system fail the original message can still be recovered.

    "Often we can break the information we wish to communicate down into yes/no questions. In the light switch example, the switch is either on or off. We can encode these two possibilities as $1$ and $0$, where $1$ is on and $0$ is off. This is an example of a _bit_. A bit represents a physical system with two possible states which we label $0$ and $1$. If Alice wants to indicate she if working from home she sends a $1$ and otherwise she sends a $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An error occurs when the bit changes physical state; that is, a $0$ becomes a $1$ or a $1$ becomes a $0$. These are called _bit-flip errors_. For instance, if Alice tries to send a $1$ but the light switch fails, Bob will receive a $0$ and incorrectly interpret the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce this risk we add redundancy to the system. In the earlier example with three switches Alice sends a $0$ or a $1$ for each switch; or equivalently, the binary string $000$ or $111$. However, due to physical imperfections in the communication channel, any of these bits can flip and Bob could receive any of the $2^8$ possible triples of 0's and 1's. For example, if Alice sends $111$ but the middle switch fails, then Bob will receive the message $101$. Since two of the three bits are 1's, Bob can deduce it is more likely that only one error occurred and the intended message was $111$.\n",

    "Binary strings of length $n$ are vectors over $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^n$. In this example, Alice sends a vector from the vector subspace $\\{(0,0,0), (1,1,1)\\}$. However, due to errors, Bob could receive any vector in $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. This idea can be generalised by choosing suitable subspaces of $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^n$ to define _error-correcting codes_, that allow both the detection and correction of errors in transmitted messages."

Decoding aims to recover the original codeword despite these errors. Without knowing the exact errors that occurred, we cannot be certain that decoding will find the intended message. So instead we try to find the codeword that is most likely to have been sent. More precisely, let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a code of length $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and suppose we receive a message $m \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$.

    "Using the Hamming distance makes it faster to apply the maximum likelihood decoder. However, for a code $\\mathcal{C}$ with rank $k$, it still requires computing and comparing $2^k$ different numbers. Therefore, as the code gets bigger the Maximum Likelihood Decoder becomes computationally impractical. We need more efficient algorithms that estimate the most likely codeword without having to compute the Hamming distances explicitly."

    "This algorithm involves running over different bits and parity checks updating the probabilities the sent bit was $0$ or $1$. The algorithm is suited to Tanner graphs that are sparse, since then only a few bits influence each parity check equation. Therefore, this is a decoder often used for LDPC codes. The main difficulty is deciding which bit and parity check to use at each step. If the same nodes are used too often then the influence of the rest of the graph is lost and the estimates become less reliable.\n",

    "Assume the code has length $n$ and we receive a message $r_1 r_2 \\dots r_n$. Let us denote the message that was sent by $s_1 s_2 \\dots s_n$. We first calculate the probability that each of the received bits is correct based on the probabilities that there will be a bit-flip in the channel. Assume the channel is symmetric, so the bit-flip probability is the same whether the bit is $0$ or $1$. Let the flip probability be $p$. The bit $r$ is correct if and only if no flip occurs, so  \n",
