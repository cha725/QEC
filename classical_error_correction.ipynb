The idea is efficient but it depends entirely on the light functioning. If the bulb fails, Bob may draw the wrong conclusion despite Alice’s intention remaining unchanged. To reduce this risk Alice could instead turn on the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom lights. It is unlikely that all three bulbs fail at once, so Bob is far more likely to receive the intended message.\n",

    "\n",
    "A simple way to reduce errors is to increase redundancy by sending multiple copies of the same bit. We then assume that the value appearing most often is the intended message. For example, suppose that Alice sends $111$ and each bulb has probability $0.1$ of failure. Suppose that Bob receives $101$. The probability that only the middle bit flipped is $0.9 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.081$, whereas the probability the other two bits flipped is $0.1 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.009$. Therefore, it is much more likely that only one bit flipped and the intended message was $111$. In general, the most likely codeword is the one where the fewest bits have flipped, which corresponds to the majority of bits. This method is called majority decoding.\n",

The algorithm is suited to Tanner graphs that are sparse, since then only a few bits influence each parity check equation. Therefore, this is a decoder often used for LDPC codes. The main difficulty is deciding which bit and parity check to use at each step. If the same nodes are used too often then the influence of the rest of the graph is lost and the estimates become less reliable.\n",
