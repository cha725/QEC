The idea is efficient but it depends entirely on the light functioning. If the bulb fails, Bob may draw the wrong conclusion despite Alice’s intention remaining unchanged. To reduce this risk Alice could instead turn on the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom lights. It is unlikely that all three bulbs fail at once, so Bob is far more likely to receive the intended message.\n",

    "\n",
    "Errors can occur when a bit changes state: for example a $0$ becomes a $1$ or a $1$ becomes a $0$. These are called bit-flip errors. For example, if Alice tries to send $1$ by turning the light on but the bulb fails, Bob will interpret it as a $0$ and misread the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to reduce errors is to increase redundancy by sending multiple copies of the same bit. We then assume that the value appearing most often is the intended message. For example, suppose that Alice sends $111$ and each bulb has probability $0.1$ of failure. Suppose that Bob receives $101$. The probability that only the middle bit flipped is $0.9 \\cdot 0.1 \\cdot 0.9 = 0.081$, whereas the probability the other two bits flipped is $0.1 \\cdot 0.9 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.009$. Therefore, it is much more likely that only one bit flipped and the intended message was $111$. In general, the most likely codeword is the one where the fewest bits have flipped, which corresponds to the majority of bits. This method is called majority decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more copies Alice sends the more likely Bob will choose the intended message. However, there is a trade-off. Sending more copies also increases the number of bits Bob must check, which takes more time and reduces efficiency. We can see this in the following example."

    "The generator matrix of the dual code $\\mathcal C^{\\perp}$ of a code $\\mathcal{C}$ is called the _parity check matrix_ of $\\mathcal{C}$ and is denoted by $H$. The parity check matrix is useful to determine vectors that are codewords of $\\mathcal{C}$. Each of the rows of $H$ is a codeword in the dual code $\\mathcal{C}^\\perp$. Therefore, its dot product with a codeword of $\\mathcal{C}$ is 0 and we have a vector $v \\in (\\mathbb Z/2\\mathbb Z)^n$ lies in the code $\\mathcal C$ if and only if $$H v^{\\mathrm T} = 0.$$\n",
